## Hey there.

I'm nezsha, a junior software developer with ~5 years of experience in coding.
This profile was made only for publishing my code for [Euroskill](https://worldskills.org/media/news/euroskills-gdansk-2023-concludes/)

As many of you know [Github is known for stealing code](https://thenextweb.com/news/github-copilot-works-so-well-because-it-steals-open-source-code-strips-credit) and this is one of the many reasons I avoid this platform.
